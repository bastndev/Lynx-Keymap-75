# Build Instructions

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Development Scripts

### Compile (Type check + Lint + Bundle)
```bash
npm run compile
```

### Watch Mode (Development)
```bash
npm run watch
```

### Type Checking Only
```bash
npm run check-types
```

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint          # Check for issues
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix issues
```

### Production Build
```bash
npm run package       # Optimized build for publishing
npm run vscode:prepublish  # Same as package
```

## Project Structure
- `src/` - TypeScript source files
- `out/` - Bundled JavaScript files (generated by esbuild)
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `esbuild.js` - Build configuration (bundler)
- `.eslintrc.json` - ESLint configuration

## Development Features
- **esbuild**: Fast bundling and minification
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and modern JS features
- **ESLint**: Code quality and style checking
- **Source Maps**: Debugging support
- **Watch Mode**: Auto-rebuild on file changes

## VSCode Integration
- Press `F5` to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host
- Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task" → "npm: watch" for development

## Notes
- The extension entry point is `out/extension.js` (bundled from `src/extension.ts`)
- All source files converted from JavaScript to TypeScript with proper typing
- Production builds are minified and optimized
- Development builds include source maps for debugging
